## Designing a Universal Reasoning Engine: Implementation Guide for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)
This guide documents the theoretical foundations, Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with Choice (ZFC) formalisms, and 
software architecture required to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) within a Structural Complexity Reduction framework.

## 1. Theoretical Bridge: Grounding Propositional Search in ZFC Set Theory
A typical algorithmic failure mode is treating Boolean SAT variables as ungrounded integer indices. In our architecture, the Modeling Layer (DSL) acts as a constructive compiler that formalizes abstract mathematical relations from ZFC set theory into an exact propositional calculus.

# The Problem in ZFC Axiomaics
Let the set of cities be a finite set $V$ with cardinality $\vert{}V\vert{} = n \in \omega$. The tour ordering is indexed by the finite ordinal $T = n = \{0, 1, \dots, n - 1\}$.
